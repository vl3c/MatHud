To initialize and install Python dependencies for this repository after it's cloned, you can follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python --version
```

2. Next, you need to create a virtual environment. This can be done using the "venv" module that comes with Python. Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

3. After the virtual environment is created, you need to activate it. On Unix or MacOS, run:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows, run:

```sh
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the required dependencies using pip. The dependencies are listed in the "requirements.txt" file. Run the following command to install them:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Now all the dependencies should be installed. Please export your OpenAI API key to the OPENAI_API_KEY system variable or place the key in a file called ".env" one level above the main folder:

```sh
..\.env should contain the line OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

7. You can start the application using the VSCode runner or by running the following command in the main folder:
```sh
python app.py
```
