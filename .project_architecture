# Technical Architecture

## Frontend Chat Interface (index.html and main.py)
- Simple HTML structure with chat history div, input field, and send button
- Chat interface bound to both button click and Enter key events
- Vision toggle checkbox for canvas image capture control
- Uses Brython (Python in the browser) for frontend logic

## AI Interface Layer (ai_interface.py)
- Core class `AIInterface` manages communication between UI and backend
- Maintains dictionary of available functions for math operations and canvas manipulation
- Handles function call results and maintains state between interactions
- Key methods:
  - `interact_with_ai`: Entry point for user interactions
  - `_send_prompt_to_ai`: Prepares and sends prompts with canvas state
  - `_parse_ai_response`: Processes AI responses and function calls

## Backend API (app.py and openai_api.py)
- Flask server handles message routing and AI communication
- `OpenAIChatCompletionsAPI` class manages OpenAI API interactions
- Maintains conversation history and handles vision-based features
- Uses Selenium WebDriver for canvas image capture when vision is enabled

## Function Call Processing
- `ProcessFunctionCalls` class handles execution and undo/redo functionality
- Supports both synchronous and intermediate result requests
- Validates function calls against available functions
- Maintains execution state and results

## Canvas System
- Uses SVG for rendering mathematical objects and functions
- Supports zooming, panning, and coordinate system transformations
- Maintains object state for undo/redo operations
- Handles real-time updates and user interactions

## Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive logging system for debugging and session tracking
- Error handling at multiple levels (UI, function calls, API)
- Graceful fallbacks for vision system failures
- Session-based log files with timestamped entries

## Vision Integration
- Optional vision system using Selenium WebDriver
- Captures canvas state as images for AI context
- Maintains synchronization between visual and internal states
- Handles browser-based SVG manipulation and image capture

## Function Call Flow
1. User sends message → `interact_with_ai`
2. Message bundled with canvas state → `_send_prompt_to_ai`
3. AJAX request to Flask backend → `/send_message`
4. OpenAI API processes request → `create_chat_completion`
5. Response parsed and function calls executed → `_parse_ai_response`
6. Results displayed in chat and/or rendered on canvas
