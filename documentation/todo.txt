# Delivery Plan (P0/P1/P2)

## P0 - Reliability (implement first)
- fix angle creation undo/redo transaction flow to prevent partial state commits
- add rollback on multi-step drawable creation failures (points/segments/angles)
- harden workspace import with schema versioning and backward-compatible migrations
- improve renderer parity checks so Canvas2D/SVG produce consistent geometry and labels
- add WebGL renderer parity checks after WebGL feature-completeness improves (labels/text and full drawable parity)

## P1 - Core User Value (implement after P0)
- snapping: point/object snapping, grid snapping, coordinate readout
- data entry: table view, CSV import/export, measurement overlays
- plotting: scatter/histogram/box plot, polar graphs, implicit function plotting
- geometry: construction tools, relation inspector, transforms
- interaction: tracing/root-finding tools, dynamic sliders, interactive graph editing
- statistics: summaries, additional distributions, probability calculators

## P2 - Advanced and Expansion
- construction history timeline and reusable macros
- vector fields, contour/heatmap rendering
- graph theory: algorithm playback, generators, matrix view
- multi-view: split screen, tabbed workspaces, dual display
- animation timeline controls, locus generation
- session snapshots with diff/restore
- keyboard shortcut editor and command palette
- 3D graphing and shape visualization

## Milestones
- Milestone 1 (Stability): all P0 items
- Milestone 2 (Interaction): snapping, table view, CSV, measurement overlays
- Milestone 3 (Plotting + Stats): scatter/histogram/box plot, polar, implicit, distributions, probability calculators
- Milestone 4 (Geometry): construction tools, relation inspector, transforms, tracing/sliders
- Milestone 5 (Graph Workflow): interactive graph editing, algorithm playback, generators, matrix view
- Milestone 6 (Advanced): remaining P2 items (visualization, productivity, 3D)
