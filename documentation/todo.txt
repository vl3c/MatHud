# Bug Fixes

# Quick Wins (High Value, Easier Implementation)
- add table view for function values and lightweight tabular data exploration
- add scatter plot, histogram, and box plot visualization
- add parametric graphing support (x(t), y(t))
- add polar graph support for functions in polar coordinates (r = f(θ))
- add implicit function plotting (f(x,y) = 0 style equations)
- add tangent and normal line drawing at a point
- add grid snapping and coordinate readout on graph hover
- add rationalize support (and document it)

# Core Mathematical Tools (Medium Effort)
- add row operations / row-reduction workflows (rref, row swaps, etc.)
- add eigenvalue and eigenvector computation
- add complex number utilities plus base-n calculations and conversions (binary, octal, hexadecimal)
- add sequence and series calculations (summation, products, convergence tests)
- add summation and product operators for discrete analysis (Sigma, Pi)
- add numerical methods (Newton's method, Simpson's rule, trapezoidal rule)
- expand number theory functions (prime factorization, modular arithmetic)
- add conic section specialized tools
- add inequality graphing and systems of inequalities with shading controls

# Statistics and Data Analysis
- add statistical hypothesis testing workflows (z-test, t-test, chi-square, F-test)
- add confidence interval and ANOVA tools
- add data list correlation and covariance functions
- add probability plot visualization (Q-Q plots, P-P plots)
- add cumulative frequency tables and graph generation
- add list and spreadsheet structures for numeric and symbolic data (support formulas, basic stats, and function links)

# Advanced Visualization Features
- add interactive tracing, root/extrema/intersection finding tools
- add vector field visualization
- add dynamic sliders to manipulate parameters in real time
- add recursive/sequence graphing mode
- add animation capabilities for transformations and function changes
- add split screen and tabbed workspace modes to compare different graphs/calculations

# Advanced Mathematical Tools (Higher Effort)
- add differential equations solver with visualization of direction fields and solution families
- add numerical ODE solvers
- add truth tables and boolean algebra workflows for logic and circuit analysis
- add financial mathematics (compound interest, annuities, amortization, bond valuation)

# Future 3D Features
- add 3D graphing capabilities and 3D shape visualization
- add parametric equation plotting in 3D
- add 3D surface plotting (plane, sphere, cylinder templates)
- add rotation, zoom, and cross-section tools for 3D visualization
- add vector field and gradient visualization in 3D space

# Static Typing Rollout
- add type stubs or protocols for Brython `browser` module usage in client code
