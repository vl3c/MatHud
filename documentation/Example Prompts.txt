# AI-First Prompting Notes
- Primary workflow: describe intent in chat and let the AI perform tool calls.
- Include constraints and references (names, relationships, desired bounds) to improve deterministic outcomes.
- Use canvas gestures only as optional support (e.g., quickly capturing coordinates), not as required steps.

# Graph theory (graphs, trees, DAGs)
# Notes:
# - "plot" is for function plots. "graph" here means vertices and edges (graph theory).
# - When you ask for analysis like shortest path, use the vertex names you see on the canvas (often A, B, C, ...).
# - Directed edges render as vectors; undirected edges render as segments. Weighted edges display midpoint labels.
