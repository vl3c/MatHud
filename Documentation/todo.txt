# Bug Fixes

# Basic Mathematical Tools
- implement full matrix operations (addition, multiplication, inverse, determinants, row operations)
- add complex number utilities plus base-n calculations and conversions (binary, octal, hexadecimal)
- expand number theory functions (prime factorization, gcd, lcm, modular arithmetic)
- add truth tables and boolean algebra workflows for logic and circuit analysis
- add table view for function values and lightweight tabular data exploration

# Advanced Mathematical Tools
- add sequence and series calculations (summation, products, convergence tests)
- add differential equations solver with visualization of direction fields and solution families
- add numerical methods (Newton's method, Simpson's rule, trapezoidal rule, numerical ODE solvers)
- add eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations for advanced linear algebra

# Statistics and Analysis
- add probability distribution tools and statistical hypothesis testing workflows
- add regression analysis with multiple models (linear, polynomial, exponential, logarithmic)
- add financial mathematics (compound interest, annuities, amortization, bond valuation)

# 2D Graphing Enhancements
- add region coloring for complex bounded areas and inequality-defined zones
- add piecewise function support and graphing
- add implicit function plotting
- add conic section specialized tools
- add inequality graphing and systems of inequalities with shading controls
- add vector field visualization
- add polar graph support for functions in polar coordinates
- add animation capabilities for transformations and function changes
- add split screen and tabbed workspace modes to compare different graphs/calculations

# Future 3D Features
- add 3D graphing capabilities and 3D shape visualization
- add parametric equation plotting in 3D
